# ⚛️ Quantum-Inspired-Photonic-Solar-Efficiency-Prediction 🌞✨

We mix physics, QUANTUM PHOTONICS (quantum dots, Photonic crystals, Plasmonic Nanostructures) to **predict how efficient solar panels can be** by analyzing tiny particles, light waves, and more! Imagine helping Bangladesh’s power grid get smarter and greener — saving energy and our planet at the same time. 🌍⚡️

## Motivation for this? 💡

* Bangladesh’s **national grid** is growing but still faces blackouts and pollution problems. Next-gen solution can be Quantum Photonics!
* My models help **optimize solar energy**, making it cheaper and more reliable.
* Cleaner energy means a happier planet and brighter futures for all! 🌱🌞
